## Getting Started

### Setup
For a smooth installation process, please follow the instructions in the same order as given below.
#### Visual Studio Community
Download and install Visual Studio Community 2019. For the current version (2022) or older versions (< 2019), please refer to this <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">link</a>.

---

</p>

(Check if it can be updated to the latest version 3.26.4.)

---

#### GCC Compiler
To install GCC 5.4 on Linux platform
```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

To install GCC 5.4 on Windows platform
Since GCC is not coded for the Windows OS, a GCC port of MinGW-w64 is required. The '-w64' suffix indicates that it can support both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.

The steps to install it are as follows:
1. Download the MinGW-w64 executable file from the folder above.
2. Start the installer and click **Next >** until you reach the installation options page
3. Here, ensure that the options look exactly like the image below.

</p>

4. Click **Next >**. You might run into an error that says, **"The file has been downloaded incorrectly."** In this case, click **OK** and **Finish** to close the installation window.
5. To overcome the installation error, we need to add the path of the bin directory to the system path to make all the MinGW commands and tools available system wide. For this, follow the steps as shown in the video.
